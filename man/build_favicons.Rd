\title{Create favicons from package logo}
\usage{
build_favicons(pkg = ".", overwrite = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{pkg}{Path to package.}

\item{overwrite}{If \code{TRUE}, re-create favicons from package logo.}
}
\description{
This function auto-detects the location of your package logo (with the name
\code{logo.svg} (recommended format) or \code{logo.png}) and runs it through the
\url{https://realfavicongenerator.net} API to build a complete set of favicons
with different sizes, as needed for modern web usage.
}
\details{
You only need to run the function once. The favicon set will be stored in
\code{jamstack/favicon} and copied by \code{\link[=init_site]{init_site()}} to the relevant location when
the website is rebuilt.

Once complete, you should add \verb{jamstack/} to \code{.Rbuildignore } to avoid a NOTE
during package checking.
}
